"PRIVILEGE" - There are too many reason to give up but very less to hold; 
people with privilege surely has headstart & safety net to fall back on their 
obsatacles/failures,which is surely not for underprivileged one.
They live a life thats been provided by the background they come from,
having said that definetly not glorifying the hardship faced by underprivileged one,
but their shier commitment & will for not giving up is what makes them stand out. 
life is unfair but working hard always remains constant either way!
